          <h1>About Us</h1>
          <p>
We have created this recipe app to allow users to search for their favourite recipes. You can simply type in the key ingredient and our app will give you many options. 
The website provides step-by-step instructions for each recipe, along with ingredient lists, nutritional information.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
This includes people of all ages and backgrounds who enjoy cooking or want to improve their cooking skills. 
Additionally, the app could cater to individuals with specific dietary requirements or preferences, such as vegans, vegetarians, gluten-free or dairy-free diets.
<br></br>
<br></br>
<br></br>
The recipe app will address the problem of people not having access to a convenient and comprehensive resource for finding recipes. 
It will provide users with a platform to easily search for and save recipes based on their dietary preferences, ingredients, and cooking time. 
Our product streamlines the recipe-finding and meal planning process, saving users time and reducing the stress of meal preparation.
