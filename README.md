# Meal Master - React Recipe App

This is a React app that allows users to search for recipes based on keywords and dietary preferences. The app uses the Edamam API to fetch recipe data, and displays the results using a combination of Material UI and Bootstrap components.

## Getting Started

To use the app, simply clone the repository and install the required packages using `npm install`:

git clone https://github.com/DesislavaMetodieva/meal-master.git
cd meal-master
### `npm install`

Once the packages are installed, you can start the app using `npm start`:

### `npm start`

The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/.

### Usage

To search for recipes, enter a keyword or phrase in the search bar and select any dietary preferences using the checkboxes. Click the "Search" button to fetch the results from the Edamam API. The app will display a list of recipes that match the search criteria, along with their ingredients, nutritional information, and a link to the original source.

You can also click on a recipe to view more details and instructions on how to prepare it.
